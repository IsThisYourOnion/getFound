# GetFound: The Project Premise

The essence of this ongoing project is to gather job descriptions in a focused manner, parse them, and assemble the parsed information into a "Master Keyword Resume". 

This concept of a master keyword resume revolves around the idea of a resume rich in keywords relevant to the specific industry and role. This concept takes advantage of the algorithms used by many job posting services, which scan stored resumes for specific keywords to find suitable candidates. 

Through the use of this tool, you can streamline your job search process and increase your visibility to recruiters and employers by ensuring your resume contains the most relevant and sought-after keywords in your industry.

## How GetFound Works

This project has a twofold approach:

1. **Data Collection**: Leveraging powerful web scraping libraries in Python, it automates the process of collecting relevant job descriptions from LinkedIn. The script searches for job listings using specific keywords, fetches the job descriptions, and saves them for further processing.

2. **Keyword Extraction and Resume Building**: In the subsequent stage, the tool will parse through the gathered job descriptions, extracting common and essential keywords from these descriptions. These keywords will then be assembled into the master keyword resume, ensuring the resulting resume is highly relevant and attractive to job posting services.

GetFound is still under development, and future updates will include the keyword extraction and resume building functionalities. 

This project simplifies the labor-intensive process of customizing a resume for each job application, and it can dramatically enhance a candidate's visibility in job search engines and platforms. By automating these steps, GetFound aims to make the job hunting process more efficient and effective. 

Stay tuned for future updates and enhancements to the GetFound project.
