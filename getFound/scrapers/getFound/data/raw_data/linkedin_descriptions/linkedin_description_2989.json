We are the leaders in assessing and scoring responsible operations and provide independent, measured emission profiles, including methane, via high fidelity continuous monitoring technology that helps companies take ESG action.Formed as a Public Benefit Corporation (B-Corp rating score 107), Project Canary’s Denver-based team of technologists, engineers, and seasoned industry operators have earned recognition for their uncompromising standards and high-fidelity data. Project Canary’s mission is to fight climate change and put actionable insights starting with the energy sector. We ingest data from various sources, including our own proprietary environmental sensors/hardware, to calculate carbon emissions from different facilities in real-time via SaaS. The resulting independent data can inform the procurement of offsets in real-time using microtransactions, formulate a data-driven ESG strategy that investors now demand, improve operations by identifying problem areas in minutes, and bolster customer engagement through radical supply chain transparency.Founded in 2019, Project Canary, PBC has quickly gained recognition as a major mover in the continuous monitoring space.Here are some highlights from last year:Fundraise totaling $121M, Series A of $10M in 2021 and Series B of $111M in 2022 Certified as a B-Corporation with a score of 107.6 Recognized as Best for the World (top 5% of all B-Corps) in 2 out of 5 categories Governance (transparency and ethics) Workers (treatment of teammates and cultureHeadcount growth by 14X since 2021If you enjoy a growth-stage environment, mission-driven work, we want to hear from you.
