We look for candidates who are motivated to solve real-world problems in health outcomes and medicine with the latest research in deep learning, specifically within the domains of Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning, Ontologies and Graph Neural Networks.Our mission:Our mission is to organize, advance and deploy the world's medical evidence, to accelerate equitable, science-based care. The healthcare system is facing two fundamental challenges. First, there is already more knowledge than is humanly possible to stay current on and apply effectively. Second, there is insufficient medical evidence to advance research and practice and enable precision medicine at scale. Despite magnificent efforts, fewer than 20% of clinical practice guideline recommendations are based on high-quality evidence. Addressing these challenges is a pressing need, and will help timely diagnosis, burnout and the >$1T of healthcare waste. To solve these challenges we are designing and building first-of-kind evidence-based AI that we believe lays the foundation for radical enhancements across medical decision making, new medical evidence generation, and equitable AI.Day to day work in the RecoverX ML research and engineering team:We combine large language models, ontological reasoning and our knowledge graph that is based on world-class computable evidence to contextually understand patient information from Electronic Health Records and other sources, create clinical state understanding and suggest evidence-based next-best-actions for clinicians in real-time. We are building multiple products on our first-of-kind core platform, including a clinical Co-Pilot, an NLP API, algorithmic publishing and contextualized analytics.What you will get:- To join the early stage AI research and engineering team pioneering evidence-based AI in medicine- Challenging, mission driven work in a collaborative environment with support and encouragement for self-development- Access to industry level GPUs and a mixture of cutting edge technologies including LLMs, RL, graphs and ontologies- A collaborative environment with no red tape when it comes to brainstorming and implementing ideas.What we expect from you:- Fluent in Python and solid experience in designing and developing deep learning models- High aptitude and curiosity to learn and apply emerging technologies- A team player with ability to communicate complicated results clearly and effectively- Commitment to the missionGood to haves:- Experience with PyTorch- Experience with transformer-based architectures for natural language processing- Solid understanding of reinforcement learning frameworks- Solid understanding of knowledge graphs, ontologies and related deep learning frameworksBenefits and perks:- You will be based in San Francisco with a market rate salary- Excellent stock package- Excellent health benefits and 401k plan with matching- Rapid career progression opportunities- For outstanding candidates not already based in SF, visa sponsorship and relocation\n      "
